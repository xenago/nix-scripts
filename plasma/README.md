# plasma

Configure KDE Plasma desktop environment.

## Disable hot corners

By default, moving the cursor into the corner does some annoying stuff; this can be disabled.

1. Open the System Settings application
2. Navigate to `Mouse & Touchpad > Screen Edges`
3. Click each highlighted square (by default, usually just the top left) and select `No Action`
4. Click `Apply`
